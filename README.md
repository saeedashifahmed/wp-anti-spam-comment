### How Does It Work?

1. **Action URL Removed** — The comment form's action URL is stripped from the HTML
2. **User Interaction Required** — JavaScript restores the URL with a unique hash when the user scrolls, moves the mouse, touches the screen, or focuses on the form
3. **Multi-Layer Validation** — Server validates the hash token, checks the honeypot field, and verifies submission timing
4. **Spam Blocked** — Any failed validation instantly returns a 403 response
