Advanced, lightweight, GDPR-compliant anti-spam protection for WordPress comments. No setup required.

== Description ==

Anti-Spam Comment Shield is a fast, reliable anti-spam plugin for the **default WordPress commenting system**. It blocks automated bot submissions using layered validation, while keeping the experience clean for real visitors.

== Important ==
* Clear your page cache after activation or after changing plugin settings.
* Works with the default WordPress comment form only (not AMP comment forms).

= Features =
* 🛡️ **Hash-Based Verification** — Blocks bots by hiding the comment form action URL
* 🍯 **Honeypot Trap** — Hidden field that catches bots filling every input
* ⏱️ **Time-Based Check** — Rejects comments submitted too quickly
* 🔒 **REST API Protection** — Blocks unauthenticated REST API comments
* 📊 **Spam Statistics Dashboard** — Real-time total & daily blocked spam counter
* ⚙️ **Modern Settings Page** — Beautiful card-based UI with toggle switches
* 🔔 **Admin Bar Counter** — See blocked spam count in the admin bar
* ✏️ **Custom Block Message** — Personalize the blocked spam response
* 100% GDPR Compliant — No external requests, no cookies, no tracking
* Captcha-Free — Completely invisible to your visitors
* ~200 bytes inline JavaScript — Zero performance impact
* Compatible with all page caching and performance optimization plugins

= How does it work? =
1. The plugin removes the comment form action URL from raw HTML output.
2. When real user interaction is detected (scroll, mouse move, touch, or focus), JavaScript restores the action URL with a unique hash token.
3. On submit, the server validates the hash token, checks the honeypot field, and verifies submission timing.
4. If any check fails, the request is blocked with a 403 response before spam can reach your database.

== Installation ==

To install from the WordPress Dashboard:

1. Go to Plugins menu > Add New

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to configure the plugin? =
Go to Settings > WP Anti-Spam to enable or disable protection modules, adjust timing thresholds, customize the blocked message, and review spam statistics.

= How to test whether the plugin is working? =
Open any post with comments enabled and submit a normal comment. If the comment is accepted, the plugin is working. If you see a 403 error, clear your page cache and try again. If it still fails, your theme may use a custom comment form ID—please open a support topic.

= Which commenting system is supported? =
Only the default WordPress commenting system is supported. Third-party systems such as Disqus, JetPack Comments, wpDiscuz, and AMP comments are not supported.

= How to get technical assistance? =
Please open a support topic on WordPress.org or contact us via rabbitbuilds.com. We typically respond within 24 hours.
